Use this: https://github.com/1wilkens/pam-auth
and also the posix crate (specifically http://mahkoh.github.io/posix/doc/posix/pwd/fn.getpwuid.html)

This is the same way sway-lock works, though it means we'll need unsafe code calling into getpwuid. Which is ok I guess.
Everything else should be guichy
